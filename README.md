## Project Overview
We are focused on giving parents in Philadelphia the information they need to select the best school for their child by aggregating all the data available. Our tool is designed to help guide decisions about the most appropriate school based off each individualâ€™s needs.

In Philadelphia, parents can decide between sending their kids to the public school in their area or to one of several charter schools across the city. Parents might be concerned with comparing their local public school to charter schools in terms of distance, educational quality, safety, and student outcomes, and our goal is to allow parents to prioritize those criteria effectively. 

## Data Sources
We obtained our data from [OpenDataPhilly](https://opendataphilly.org/dataset?organization=school-district-of-philadelphia), the official open data repository for the City of Philadelphia. OpenDataPhilly contains 21 datasets related to the School District of Philadelphia.
